Hangman Game (Full Stack: Node.js + Express + Tailwind CSS)
A classic Hangman game built with a Node.js/Express backend and a modern responsive frontend (HTML, vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS). The backend serves random words and the frontend handles interactive gameplay — including a progressively drawn SVG Hangman figure.

Features

Interactive, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS

SVG-based hangman graphics updated with each wrong guess

On-screen keyboard and game status display

Playable from any web browser on any device

Easy to deploy with a single link
